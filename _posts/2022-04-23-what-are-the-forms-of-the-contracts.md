### What's Required For The Contract To Be Valid?

The person must have the capacity to take legal action and the parties can freely determine the content of a contract within the limits prescribed by law. The subject of the contract should not be contrary to the mandatory rules of law, public order, general morality, and personal rights. Contracts made in violation of those are null and void from the moment they are made. The fact that some of the provisions in the contract are null and void does not affect the validity of others. However, if it is clear that the contract will not be made without these provisions, the entire contract will be absolutely null.

At the time of the contract, one of the subjects must not be objectively impossible. Otherwise, the contract will be void. Impossibility can be material, factual or legal. And finally, the declarations of the will of the parties to the contract must not be injured.

In addition to the above, in order to talk about the existence of a contract between the parties, it is necessary to agree on essential points first.  If the parties are in agreement on the essential points of the contract, the contract shall be deemed to be established even if the second-degree points are not emphasized.
If the second-degree points are incompatible, the judge decides the dispute based on the nature of the work.

If there is a clear disproportion between the mutual acts in a contract, if this disproportion is realized by taking advantage of the injured party's being in a difficult situation or their thoughtlessness or inexperience, the injured party may either inform the other party that it is not contractually bound, or return the performance to the contract, depending on the nature of the situation. and may request the elimination of the disproportion between the acts.

### Are There Any Special Conditions/Forms For Some Contracts?

As a general rule the validity of the contracts is not dependent on any form.
But sometimes the law can stipulate a special form for the contract. In this case, the form stipulated in the law for contracts is, as a rule, a form of validity. Contracts established without complying with the prescribed form do not constitute a provision.

It is obligatory to comply with the written form in the amendment of a contract stipulated to be made in writing in the law. However, supplementary clauses that do not contradict the text of the contract are excluded from this rule. 

It is possible for the parties to demand back the acts they performed with the thought that the contract is valid. However, despite knowing the violation of the form and the invalidity of the contract, the things given cannot be demanded back.

In the contracts that are stipulated to be made in writing, the signatures of those who are under debt must be found.
The signature must be written in the handwriting of the debtor. Secure electronic signature also has all the legal consequences of a handwritten signature. Those who cannot sign can use fingerprints, a hand-made sign or a seal, provided that it is duly approved instead of signature.

If a contract not formalized in the law is decided by the parties to be made in a certain way, the contract not concluded in a specified way shall not be bound by the parties. This is called as voluntary figure.
If the written form is decided without any determination, the provisions regarding the legal form are applied.

Examples of some contracts that stipulated legal forms:
* *The legal form is sometimes made with the land registry officer and sometimes with the judge. If the law does not specify one of these, then the competent authority is the notary*

* *Although all kinds of contracts regarding immovables are subject to legal form (with an authorized land registry officer), there is no legal form required for the inheritance sharing contract of immovables.*

* *In some cases, legal proceedings must be announced. For example, a property or business assets and transferee with liabilities, so to declare and commercial enterprises to creditors Trade Registry Gazette, starting from the date announced by to throughout Turkey for others to be published in one newspaper which is distributed, would be responsible for the debt or in business assets against them.*
