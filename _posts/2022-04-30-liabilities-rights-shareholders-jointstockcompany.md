### Liabilities of Shareholders

Shareholders’ liabilities regarding corporate debts are limited. The principal liability of the shareholder in a joint-stock company is **to fulfil the capital that they have committed.** They are responsible only to the company. The partners cannot be held liable for the public debts of the company. In this way, a joint-stock company ensures that the shareholders’ personal assets are exempted from the losses and risks undertaken by the company.

In cases where the share transfers are subject to approval by the company, the shareholders **may be given the obligation to fulfil certain recurring obligations that are not related to money**, in addition to the liabilities from the capital commitment, by the articles of association.

The shareholders are obliged **not to disclose confidential information or share company secrets.** Those who violate this obligation are obliged to compensate the material and immaterial damages of the company and are also punished with a judicial fine according to Article 562.

### Rights of Shareholders

Profit is the legal benefit of the share, that is, its periodic yields. **The shareholder's right to dividend** is a conditional demand based on the share. The annual profit is calculated and determined according to the annual balance sheet. It is the conclusion part that is important in the annual balance. If the result is positive, there is a profit, if it is negative, there is damage.

In order to distribute the profit determined according to the annual balance in a joint-stock company, two conditions must be met:
* There should be no reduction in legal reserves.
* A definite profit must be present.

According to the Turkish Commercial Code System, the following conditions must be met for Dividend Distribution:
* According to the annual balance, a profit must have been made or, a legal reserve should have been set aside from the previous year's profits for this purpose. 
* Legal and optional reserves must be separated from the net profit for the period.
The general assembly decision regarding the distribution of the dividend gives the right to claim to both the shareholders and other interested parties as of the date of the decision.
The statute of limitation is 5 years. that is, the shareholders must claim the dividend from the company within five years.

**A liquidation share** is a share that belongs to the shareholder as a result of the division of the remaining asset among the shareholders after all debts of the company are paid and the share prices are returned at the end of the company's dissolution and liquidation.
Unless otherwise stipulated under the articles of association, the liquidation remaining share is distributed among the shareholders in proportion to the capital paid and their privilege rights.

When a joint-stock company goes for a capital increase, it is necessary to **apply to the shareholders** first and to give them the opportunity to buy new shares in proportion to their shares, without applying to third parties.

Shareholders have the **right to participate in the general assembly and make suggestions, as well as vote.** It is one of the most important rights of the shareholders to influence the company management. Voting rights can also be exercised through a representative.

Shareholders have the **right to obtain information based on asking questions, the right to examine the commercial ledger** and the right to obtain the **requested information through the court** in case of unjust rejection of the request for information and examination.

Each shareholder may **request a special auditor.**
