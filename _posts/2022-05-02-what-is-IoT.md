The word "things" in the term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to machines or devices embedded with sensors that collect, store and analyze information. When these objects are connected to the Internet and a central data server, they can upload this data for further processing and leverage it to facilitate many tasks to be performed.
An object need not have super storage or supercomputer inside; it just needs to be able to connect to them.

### What Are The Usage Areas of Internet of Things?

In addition to smartphones, laptops, coffee machines, refrigerators, personal devices such as Google Home, Apple Watch and Fitbit are among the devices supported by the Internet of Things.These and many other objects that we use in our daily life are getting smarter day by day as they collect and exchange data over the internet.

Sensors monitor things like lighting, temperature, energy use. By processing this sensor data, smart algorithms can manage energy use much more effectively than humans can, saving costs and energy.Besides that With the sensors that collect very important information about the environment, natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis can be detected in advance (in such cases, even seconds are important) and thus human lives can be saved. These are just a few examples. As mentioned above, IoT is in our daily lives.

### Data Privacy In IoT

Although IoT makes daily life easier, it also brings some problems. One of the main problems is data privacy. IoT usually involves the processing of personal data relating to specific or identifiable natural persons and is therefore considered personal data under GDPR. In some cases it is hard to know what data is collected, how it is processed and where it is transferred. 

GDPR, e-Privacy Directive and possible national legal regulations apply to IoT data processing at the European Union level. At Council of Europe level, convention 108+ will apply to data processing in the context of IoT.

Subscribers and IoT users in general are considered data subjects under European Union law. If the data they collect and store is only used for personal or household purposes, they will consider under the GDPR "household exception". The IoT processing model in practice entails the systematic transfer of user's data to device manufacturers, app developers and other third parties that qualify as data controllers. Therefore, the household exemption will be applied to a limited extent within the scope of IoT.
The processing of data in IoT may be related to individuals who are not subscribers or real users of IoT. For example, wearable devices such as smart glasses are also likely to collect data about someone other than the owner of the device.

Stakeholders qualified as data controllers in accordance with European Union law, individually or together with others, have to comply with different obligations determined by GDPR and e-privacy directive. Similar to cloud computing services, the GDPR on security obligations also applies to IoT. Any stakeholder qualified as a data controller is fully responsible for the security of data processing. If you pay attention, security measures will be implemented taking into account certain operational restrictions of IoT devices. For example, most sensors today cannot establish an encrypted connection due to the priority given to the physical features of the device or cost control.
