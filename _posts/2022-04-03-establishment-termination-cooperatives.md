The concept of co-operative emerged as the result of the industrialization of the industrial revolution for the first time. Cooperatives around the world are based on economic and social thought and developed in many countries with state support. Before the republic in Turkey, the cooperative movement started with the organization of solidarity and co-operation, called *“Memleket Sandıkları”*.

The cooperatives definition has little changes from country to country, but according to ICA's universal definition, *"A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.”* According to the definition of cooperatives, it is aimed to meet needs in the best way with solidarity and cooperation. In addition, people come together with cooperatives to meet their own needs and play an important role in the development of society. Indeed, the United States and Western European countries have the cooperatives that developed are the most important indicators in this situation.

Over time, the societies have developed and their needs have begun to increase proportionally with the cooperatives and their sorts. In this century, many cooperative models have found application in the work of protecting the environment, supporting women in their work-life and emphasizing the importance of education. Each country established its own rules of law in order to ensure that all these cooperatives are legally established, and supervised and that their partners are not losing their rights. However, due to the rapid development of technology and the needs, most inland legal regulations are inadequate. This is the case in terms of Turkey. One of the most recent examples in Turkey is that in addition to the start-up of energy co-operatives, existing regulations are inadequate, which leads people to be afraid of using renewable energy sources under the cooperative roof.

In Turkey, Law No. 1163 on Cooperatives Law legislation contains general rules that apply to cooperatives in the establishment of cooperatives, issues such as expiration and rights of the shareholders are regulated by this law. In addition to this general law, two other laws that including agricultural cooperatives, have entered into force in time.

First of all, in order to establish a cooperative, at least 7 partners and a notarized a Rules signed by these partners are needed. It is necessary that a rule is in line with the existing regulations on the area in which the cooperative operates and it must be prepared in accordance with the law.

Apart from the partnership of natural persons in a cooperative, there are no obstacles to the partnership of public and private legal entities. As a matter of fact, if legal entities are cooperative partners, as in real persons; they have to pay at least one quarter of the capital they undertake and the board of directors to make a decision regarding the acceptance of the request for partnership. If the co-operative partnership is final, both in terms of natural persons and legal entities;
* With the requisition of withdrawal from membership
* Death of the member
* The transfer of membership
* Dismissal from membership

Each member has the right to withdraw from membership but in case the act of withdrawal endangers the presence of the cooperative, a provision stipulating that a just indemnity be paid to the cooperative by the withdrawing member can be included in the Rules. Besides, the usage of the right to withdraw from membership can be restricted through the Rules up to a maximum term of 5 years. It is not clearly regulated where to make the request in law although, it is accepted that the board of directors is in charge of that. 

As per the provisions stipulated in the Rules, the position of membership can be passed on to the heirs of the member but the heirs have to be eligible for membership. When the transferred the membership, if the person taking over the membership is eligible for membership, the Board of Directors accepts the membership of such person.

In addition to the above, a cooperative partnership may be terminated in cases where it is necessary for a cooperative partner to be excluded from the partnership. But members cannot be dismissed from cooperative membership for reasons other than those specified in the Rules. Dismissal from membership may be made by the Board of Directors or by the General Assembly. In both cases, the decision about dismissal is written with the cause in the written reports as well as in the members’ book. The said member can open a lawsuit of objection within three months of notification. If the notified decision has been made by the Board of Directors, the member can as well forward his/her objection to the General Assembly within the three-month period.

According to the related article in the Cooperatives Law No. 1163; it is indicated in the Rules that partners or their heirs have rights over the cooperative and what these rights are all about. At the beginning of the rights to be demanded in return, the capital shares and the money paid for the purpose of the cooperative are paid but the provisions between the reserves that were made a possible refund in the Rules are invalid.
