For centuries, people have wanted machines that could act and think like themselves. In the 1600s, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a pioneer in the field of mechanical calculators. He was the first to describe a pinwheel calculator in 1685 and invented the Leibniz wheel, used in the arithmometer, the first mass-produced mechanical calculator. In 1950, English mathematician Alan Turing, wondering if a machine could think, asked the famous question: "How can we tell if a machine is thinking?" The field of modern artificial intelligence began to take shape soon after, in 1956, when a group of Dartmouth University scientists predicted that a machine as intelligent as humans could be built in the next generation.

### Types of AI

Artificial intelligence can process data and make certain kinds of predictions faster and more accurately than humans. Artificial intelligence studies today; focuses on learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception and understanding human language. There are mainly two types of AI which are based on Functionality and Capabilities. 

### How It Works

AI generates output using a method called  machine learning.  It also needs big data in order for these actions to take place and to obtain the desired results. In other words, the more data the machine is fed (assuming that data is valid), the more accurate the output will be. *It's machine learning that lets the bank contact you that someone else might be using the stolen information from your credit card.*
Deep learning (DL) is a subcategory of machine learning that focuses on statistical models while solving problems. It uses an artificial neural network of algorithms inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems by repeatedly performing tasks thousands of times, changing a little each time to improve the result. Deep learning requires big data and massive computing power, but it has enormous potential on the way to its overall AI goal. Deep learning has been used to train self-driving cars, detect fraud, and even make "Deepfake" videos of popular celebrities.

### Data Privacy In AI

On top of all this, people may be sceptical about the privacy and protection of their data used by AI. There are debates about the legal status of the data derived by artificial intelligence. The law aims to protect personal data. It has set many rules for this and stated that the data can be processed in an anonymized way. However, the problem is what will happen if the anonymized data is personal data through artificial intelligence. Some AI technology companies argue that inferences derived from personal data should be considered trade secrets. And this claim completely changes the legal status.
However, since AI has a history of about 60 years, the laws are insufficient. In order to solve all these problems, first of all, engineers and lawyers should work together.
I will talk about this topic in another post.
