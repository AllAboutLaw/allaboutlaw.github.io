In order to be able to talk about a valid contract, the will statements of the parties are needed. In the Turkish Code of Obligations, the declaration of will is, a private outward manifestation of intention which is directly aimed at bringing about a legal effect. 
As the element of will, the existence of legal action capacity is required. Otherwise, the legal action will be invalid due to incompetence. In addition, the will must be realized as a result of the free mental activity of the person. Finally, the declarant must notify the other party of their will to take legal action or to establish a contract directly.
The declaration, which is the objective element of the contracts, is the explanation of the legal actions to the related parties by word, writing or sign. The will statement can be explicit or implicit.

In order for establishing the contract, a unilateral legal action called a proposal, is required first.
The proposal may be directed against an individual, or it may be directed at a particular community.
In order to be considered as a proposal, essential points in terms of that contract must be included in the proposal. Also, you should do it seriously and commit to it. In cases where one of the elements is missing, It is an invitation to a proposal, not a real proposal. The most important feature of the proposal is that the person to whom it is addressed is suitable for forming the contract with a declaration of acceptance.

If the proposer has foreseen that the declaration of acceptance will be sent up to a certain period of time, he/she cannot return from the proposal until the end of that period, and the contract is deemed to have been concluded with the declaration of acceptance received within the specified period.
However, If the declaration of acceptance arrives end of the period, the contract is not established. In this case, the declaration of acceptance becomes a new proposal. 
The proposer must immediately notify the other party that the declaration of acceptance that was sent on time has arrived late and therefore the contract has not been concluded, otherwise, the contract will be deemed valid.
If a deadline has not been determined by the proposer, the bindingness of the proposal will vary depending on whether the proposal is made among those who are ready. It should be noted that the proposal made through the representative also has the meaning of a proposal among those who are ready.

In cases where there is no direct contact when the proposal is made and a period of time must pass for the acceptance, there is a proposal among those who are not ready.

A contract is formed by the acceptance of a proposal containing essential elements. Acceptance is a unilateral declaration of will that must reach the other party. According to the Code of Obligations Art.5, a proposal made to a person who is not ready for admission, without a deadline, binds the proposer until a timely and duly submitted response can be expected to arrive.
Besides that, if the proposer doesn't have to wait for a clear acceptance due to the law or the nature of the work or the situation, if the proposal is not rejected in an appropriate time, the contract is deemed to have been established.

However, as a rule, silence cannot be qualified as implicit acceptance. Likewise, sending something that hasn't been ordered is not considered a proposal and the person who receives this thing is not obliged to return it or keep it.
