excerpt: A software license is a contract between the entity or a developer that created an application and its end-user. To protect your code, you need to understand the software licenses before using any code, including libraries and frameworks, you didn’t create. In this post, you will learn the basics and types of software licenses.

Before learning software licenses, we need to know the definition of software. ***Software*** is a set of data or programs used to operate and develop electronic devices that execute various tasks. It has a different task than *hardware* that the system is built. As a definition you can find in a dictionary software is all of the programs, programming languages and documentation used in computing and giving life to hardware in a computer.

### How does Software License Work?

A software license is a document that protects the rights of the copyright holder (software owner's).Licensing is essential for each part of software; This shows that you are not violating the copyright of the software owner and that you are rewarded for their efforts.The rights of the copyright holder are protected by law. Copyright laws expressly state that people cannot copy software without permission. No one may copy, distribute and use their work without the permission of the copyright holder. If you copy a computer program without permission or provide an illegal copy to someone else, you will be liable for compensation as well as committing a crime.

Besides that all software code comes with certain rights and obligations. When you write code, you reuse libraries, frameworks, code snippets and whole applications. There are many different types of software licenses. If you reuse a component without following the obligations of its license, the licensor might sue, and you might be forced to publish your own source code.

Software license agreements seek to protect the rights of both parties (users and developers).

**To protect developers:**
* Protecting developers' intellectual property and trade secrets based on copyright laws.
* Limiting what other parties can do with the covered software code.
* Limiting the liability of the vendors

**To protect users:**
* Defining what users can do with software code they did not write.
* Establishing how users stay in compliance with software licenses, protect themselves from infringement claims and limit their legal liability.
* Helping users maintain a positive relationship with software developers and vendors.
* Preventing overspending on licenses by establishing clear parameters of how many licenses an organization needs.

### What are the Types of Software Licenses?

Two common categories for software with licenses which grant the licensee specific rights are proprietary software and free and open-source software (FOSS). The difference between the two is the granting of rights to modify and re-use a software product obtained by a customer.

FOSS software licenses both rights to the customer and therefore bundles the modifiable source code with the software (open-source). Proprietary software typically does not license these rights and therefore keeps the source code hidden (closed source).

Open source communities require contributors to affirm their right to contribute code through legally binding contributor license agreements (CLA):
* **Individual CLA:** signed by an individual developer who directly contributes code to an open source project.
* **Corporate CLA:** signed by a corporation that employs groups of developers contributing to an open source project which offers additional indemnification to an open source foundation against future corporate copyright claims.
* **Software Grant Agreement (SGA):** Used when a large volume of code is donated to a foundation by a developer or entity to further bar future copyright claims once code is contributed.
* **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO):** A less formal copyright agreement introduced by Linux and favored over SLAs by some open source companies. DCO  attests that developers have the right to contribute code and it is their original creation.

Here are a few types of common software license models you should know as a developer/user:
 * **Public Domain:** This is the most permissive type of software license. And it is free to use.  Anyone can use and change it without any restrictions. You should be wary because the code, may not meet enterprise quality and security standards.
 * **Lesser General Public License:** GNU Lesser General Public License allows you to link to open source libraries in your software. However any developer who modifies an LGPL covered component is required to make their modified version available under the same LGPL license. The word "lesser" in the title shows that it doesnt guarantee the end user's complete freedom. It only guarantees the freedom of modification for components licensed under the LGPL, not for any components. Which means, you can simply compile or link an LGPL-licensed library with your own code, you can release your application under any license. But  if you modify the library or copy parts of it into your code, you’ll have to release your application under similar terms as the LGPL.
 * **Permissive License:** Also known as *Apache style* or *BSD style.*  It gives unlimited permission to use, study, and privately modify the software. Developers can make only minimal requirements about how the software can be modified or redistributed with this licenses. Permissive Licenses are the most popular licenses used with free and open source software. Another typical example of this type is MIT license.
 * **Copyleft:**  Copyleft licenses are considered protective or reciprocal in contrast with permissive free software licenses. They require that information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients of the software. This information is most commonly in the form of source code files, which usually contain a copy of the license terms and acknowledge the authors of the code.  The most popular example of a copyleft license is GPL. Copyleft is an arrangement whereby software or artistic work may be used, modified, and distributed freely on condition that anything derived from it is bound by the same conditions. *(A component’s license might say the work is free to use and distribute for personal use only. So any derivative you create would also be limited to personal use only.)*

 The examples given above belong to FOSS. Lastly, I would like to give an example of Non-free license.
 * **Proprietary:** Proprietary software is also known as non-free or closed-source software. It is the opposite of open-source or free software. It reserves some licensing rights to use, and modify. That means, it makes illegal to copy, modify or distribute. Without acceptance of the license, the end-user may not use the software at all.
