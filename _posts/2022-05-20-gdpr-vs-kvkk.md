The Turkish Personal Data Protection Law No. 6698, (*aka.KVKK*), became enforceable beginning in April of 2016,before the GDPR. The basis of <a href= "https://www.kvkk.gov.tr/Icerik/6649/Personal-Data-Protection-Law" target="_blank">KVKK</a> is <a href= "https://edps.europa.eu/sites/default/files/publication/dir_1995_46_en.pdf" target="_blank">Directive 95/46/EC.</a> 

The <a href= "https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank">GDPR</a> became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a regulation, not a directive, it is directly binding and applicable, and provides flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states. It also became a model for many other laws across the world, including in Turkey, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Kenya etc. 

Both regulations provide the protection of personal data and work to develop awareness in this respect in the public eye in line with the fundamental rights related to privacy and freedom. 

### Comparison of Some Basic Concepts

* **Definition of Personal Data:** Personal data is defined as follows in Art. 3 of **KVKK:**
“Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
In the other hand, **GDPR defines** personal data as: " personal data  means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person"
*As you can see GDPR includes the data collected online in the definition of personal data. But KVKK didn't make a detailed definition. On the other hand, the practices of the Turkish Data Protection Authority started to mention this issue.*
* **Definition of Data Processor and Data Controllor:** In **KVKK**,  “*Data Processor*” means the natural or legal person who processes personal data on behalf of the data controller upon its authorization. and “*Data Controller*” means the natural or legal person who determines the purposes and means of processing personal data and is responsible for the establishment and management of the data filing system.
**According to the GDPR**, "*controller*" means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law; "*processor*" means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.
*Even at the definitions, you can see how detailed the GDPR is and it defines subjects without leaving any question marks in mind.*
* **Data Protection Officer and Data Protection Representative:** Data Protection Officer and Data Protection Representative are two different concepts that are not regulated in the KVKK. But they are stipulated to be assigned in the presence of the conditions specified in the GDPR *(Art.27 and Art. 37)*.
* **Data Protection Impact Assessment:** This is another topic that doesn't regulated in KVKK. But GDPR stipulated it under the Article 35.

### Comparison of Territorial Scope

* **Territorial Scope According to GDPR:**  GDPR  applies when;
1. Data controllers and processors are located in the EU, whether or not the processing takes place in the EU.
2. Personal data of the data subjects residing in the EU are processed by non-EU data controllers or data processors for goods and service delivery activities, or for monitoring behavior taking place in the EU.
3. A controller not established in the Union, but in a place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law.
* **Scope According to KVKK:**  KVKK applies to natural persons whose personal data are processed and to natural or legal persons processing such data wholly or partially by automated means or by non-automated means which provided that form part of a data filing system.
*It is not clear whether data subjects or controllers or processors not located in Turkey consider a subject to KVKK. But according to the guidelines and decisions of the Turkish Data Protection Authority, it is a must that international resident data controllers who perform their data processing operations in Turkey are obliged to register with the Data Controllers Registry.*

### The Liability of the Data Breach 
GDPR regulated this topic as follows: "Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation shall have the right to receive compensation from the controller or processor for the damage suffered." *That is, both the data controller and the data processor are liable for any damages that may arise from a data breach.*

In KVKK, regulated liability for data breaches as follows: "The administrative fines listed in this article shall apply to natural persons and private law legal persons who are controllers.” *KVKK handles it a different way and it issues fines only to the controller.*
