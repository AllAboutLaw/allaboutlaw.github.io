excerpt: Even though General Processing Conditions are a new concept that is regulated recently we used them without regulation in the Code of Obligations No. 818. The practice of the Supreme Court has been instructive in this issue before the new Code of Obligations. In this article, we briefly mention its usage areas and legal status.

General processing conditions are encountered in many areas in daily life. The most well-known examples are the contracts used in banking, transportation, insurance and labor law. With the legal regulations regarding the general transaction conditions that entered our legal system with the Turkish Code of Obligations No. 6098, the deficiencies in this direction have been largely eliminated.

The law gives to the parties the freedom of contract. That means, the parties' agreement on the issues they have determined on a common point by discussing, and the freedom to make contracts as they wish constitute the structure of the individual contract model. Accordingly, individuals have the right to decide freely whether or not to make a contract, provided that it does not contradict the mandatory provisions of the law, morality, and honesty rules.

As a matter of fact, with the developing technology and industry, standard contract patterns have started to be used without negotiations such as bargaining about the contract or determining the form of the contract under the name of general transaction conditions. As such, the possibility of endangering the rights of the weakest among the contracting parties may unavoidably arise. For this reason, the obligation to protect the rights of the weak party has arisen in the contracts prepared using the general transaction conditions.

### What's the status of general transaction conditions according to the Law?

According to the definition in the Code of Obligations, the general transaction conditions are the contractual provisions that one of the contracting parties prepares in advance unilaterally and abstractly to be used in many similar contracts in the future and present to the other party. In other words, general transaction conditions are prepared to regulate the content of the contract unilaterally before the conclusion of the contract. For these conditions to be qualified as general transaction conditions, matters such as the scope of these conditions, by whom they were prepared, whether they were put on paper, the type of writing, and whether they are included in the text of the contract and the form of the contract is not important. The important thing is that the general transaction conditions are put into the contract unilaterally and make it binding, and the freedom (to determine the content) of the contract is used unilaterally.

### What are the protections and supervisions?

As we have mentioned above, to be prepared and accepted to the content of the contract without negotiation by the other party necessitates the inspection of the general transaction conditions.

*The first mode of supervision* is to ensure that the general transaction conditions, which one of the parties has not read or does not have the legal knowledge to understand, are clear and transparent. In short, the subject of the enforcement audit is to determine under which conditions the general transaction conditions will apply and which conditions will be included in the scope of the agreement. It is accepted in the doctrine that the general transaction conditions that are contrary to the individual agreement between the parties will not be valid.

*The second mode of supervision* is the review of the general transaction conditions included in the contract through interpretation. This is achieved by the judge's determination of the meaning of the general transaction conditions entered into the contract with an express and implicit agreement, in which sense it becomes binding in the contract.

*The third mode of supervision* is to control the contents of the general transaction conditions. This supervision limits the validity of the general transaction conditions, which are inappropriate in terms of content, disrupt the balance between the parties against one of the parties and include provisions contrary to equity. This issue is regulated a mandatory in the law and such provisions included in the contract are absolutely null and void.

However, it should not be forgotten that the party who uses the general transaction conditions, cannot claim that they would not have concluded a contract without these null and void conditions. Therefore, except for those that constitute partial invalidity, the contract will continue to be valid.

*Finally*, the records in the contract with the general proseccing conditions or in another related contract that authorize the party to unilaterally change a provision of the contract or introduce a new regulation against the other party are deemed not written.
This is a consequence of the "*Prohibition of replacement*". In short, the provisions that authorize the unilateral change of the contract content are not included in the contract.
