In order to answer this question, it is necessary to look at the definition of a contract. According to the legal system in Turkey, a contract is defined as a legal transaction consisting of mutual and appropriate declarations of the parties' will to produce a certain legal result.

Persons become the owners of the rights granted to them by contracts. Contract law is a sub-branch of law that gives people rights of their free will, draws the limits of the right, protects those rights, and provides the opportunity to resort to legal remedies in case of behaviour contrary to the contract.

Although there is no such area as contract law in the legal system in Turkey, contracts are mentioned in all areas of law. There are many provisions regarding contracts, their consequences and sanctions in various laws. In particular, some contract types are specifically included in the Turkish Civil Code and the Code of Obligations, the Commercial Code, the Labor Law, and the Consumer Law.
