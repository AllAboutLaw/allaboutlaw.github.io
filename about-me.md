 Hello there!
<br>
<br>
My name is Aybike Ã–zkan. I'm an attorney who works in Turkey. I work in many areas of law. But there are specific topics that I find interesting. The history of law links closely to the development of civilisation. Legal systems vary between countries, with their differences analysed in comparative law. A legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law in civil law jurisdictions. In common law systems, judges make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature. public and private law areas have brought solutions to certain problems since the beginning of civilization. <em>(for example, consequences of divorce, demanding rights from a contract, to appeal a decision of the administration...)</em>
<br>
<br>
Thanks to advancements in technology, there are many new areas that lack regulation. For example, blockchain or artificial intelligence are newer concepts. You can find many technical papers about those topics but when you look for legal advice with the regulations you will see there are so many blanks. And sometimes it's hard to understand the definition without knowing its technical terms. 
Besides those scientific terms, I care about privacy more. People should be aware of their data and how to protect them.
<br>
<br>
I share the main ideas and essentials about those topics mentioned above, with this project. I decided to share my articles under the two categories: <a href= "https://allaboutlaw.github.io/category/private-law.html">Private Law</a> and <a href= "https://allaboutlaw.github.io/category/IT-law.html">IT Law</a>.
